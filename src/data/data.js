        <p>
          The elderly man is seated at his ornate wooden desk stretched out in
          front of a bookshelf, busied with his writing. He faultlessly scribes
          onto a thick paper with a fountain pen. To his right, a wall sized
          window looks out over a large forested landscape. At the completion of
          his task, he signs the document.

        <p>
          <i>My will is finished,</i> he thought, while he stared out over the
          large forest.

        <p>
          Quickly, he opens a well-crafted wooden box and prepares a key chain
          with five keys, a small pocket watch, a vial and a pouch. Upon
          finalizing this task, he reverently folds his will neatly, placing it
          on top of the items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before closing the box, his eyes fall on a small, thin, leather bound
          black book lying on his desk.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, this will also be useful to you.</p>
        <p>
          Picking up the small object, he places it on top of his will, sets all
          the items within. As if to protect them from the unknown, he carefully
          lays strips of silk cloth,
